"I am starting a new project aimed at preventing people from drowning in lakes. The project involves creating a model that can detect people in the water. Once people are detected, the model will track how many people are in each region of the image. By dividing the image into smaller regions, I can monitor the movement of people more effectively."

"I have added a new feature to my web page where I can post content by creating a new object in my 'posts.json' file and dragging a markdown file into the posts folder. However, I faced some problems while implementing this feature and couldn't find a good article that covered all the necessary information. So, I decided to write my article explaining how I implemented this feature and how I solved the frustrating problems. If you are interested in implementing a similar feature on your website, you can read my article and find helpful information."
