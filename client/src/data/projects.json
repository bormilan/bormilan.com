      "My team developed a production line monitoring system. We used Raspberry Pi 4 boards with camera, to take images and real time video stream from the manufacturing processes, and processed the images and the stream to convert them into useful data.",
      "The main goal was to monitoring the processes and store the events in a database, for the purpose of optimization.",
      "And there was my part, an extra feature to check a specific operation and detect if the process failed, before it causes more problems."

      "The process looks like this: the user buys a detector, applies to their clock, and adds the detector by its ID, on the client side of our program. After this he/she/it just need to set the configuration values, and then the detector can start detecting the numbers.",
      "The detector sends an image to our backend, and then it processes the image to get the numbers from it, with an OCR model, and the it stores to our database(mongoDB).",
      "The client has a lot of features to help the user get the most valuable information from the data.",
      "Our plan, is to make a dashboard that is customizable by the user. Making a mobile application to afford the possibility to make the images with phone And we want to make a lot of features that supports those people who has multiply property to monitor the consumption of their renters."
